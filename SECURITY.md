## Password Security Fixes

This document outlines the security improvements made to prevent password leaks in the API Gateway application.

### Issues Fixed

1. **Hard-coded passwords** in Docker Compose files
2. **Passwords exposed in connection strings** (DATABASE_URL)
3. **Sensitive data in environment variables** visible in process lists
4. **No separation between dev and prod security practices**

### Solutions Implemented

#### Development Environment (`docker-compose.yml`)
- Uses environment variables with secure defaults
- Passwords are no longer hard-coded
- Separate environment variables instead of connection strings
- Default values are clearly marked as development-only

#### Production Environment (`docker-compose.prod.yml`)
- Uses **Docker Secrets** for all sensitive data
- Passwords are stored in separate files
- No sensitive data exposed in environment variables
- Configuration separated from credentials

### Docker Secrets Implementation

Docker secrets provide the most secure way to handle sensitive data in production:

```yaml
secrets:
  postgres_password:
    file: ./secrets/postgres_password.txt
  kong_db_password:
    file: ./secrets/kong_db_password.txt
  jwt_secret_key:
    file: ./secrets/jwt_secret_key.txt
```

### Security Best Practices

#### For Development
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`
2. Set strong passwords in your `.env` file
3. Never commit `.env` files to version control
4. Use different passwords than production

#### For Production
1. Use `docker-compose.prod.yml`
2. Generate strong, unique passwords for each service
3. Store passwords in the `secrets/` directory
4. Set appropriate file permissions (600) on secret files
5. Use a proper secrets management system in real deployments

### Environment Variables vs Docker Secrets

| Aspect | Environment Variables | Docker Secrets |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| Visibility | Visible in process lists | Not visible in process lists |
| Storage | In memory/env files | Encrypted at rest |
| Access | All processes can see | Only assigned containers |
| Rotation | Requires restart | Can be rotated without restart |
| Best for | Development | Production |

### File Permissions

Set proper permissions on secret files:

```bash
chmod 600 secrets/*.txt
chown root:root secrets/*.txt  # In production
```

### Password Requirements

- **Minimum length**: 16 characters
- **Include**: Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- **Avoid**: Dictionary words, personal information
- **Rotate**: Regularly change passwords (quarterly recommended)

### Additional Security Measures

1. **Network Security**: All services communicate within isolated Docker networks
2. **Health Checks**: Services have proper health checks for availability
3. **Restart Policies**: Proper restart policies for production stability
4. **Least Privilege**: Each service runs with minimal required permissions

### Monitoring and Alerts

Consider implementing:
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Unusual access pattern detection
- Secret rotation reminders
- Security audit logging

### Emergency Procedures

If a password is compromised:
1. Immediately change the password in the secret file
2. Restart affected services
3. Review access logs for unauthorized activity
4. Update monitoring for new credentials
5. Investigate the source of the compromise
